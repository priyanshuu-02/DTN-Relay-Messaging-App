/**
 * Central message-lifecycle event logger. Every state transition of every message goes
 * through here — the dedicated "Lifecycle" page in the UI observes [entries] to give
 * a real-time stream of exactly what the DTN layer is doing.
 *
 * Also maintains per-message hop views in the form each node sees them:
 *     source → prevHop → me → nextHop
 * That is, the node's own perspective on the route. Each phone only knows what it directly
 * observed (the message came FROM someone, was handled BY it, and went TO someone) — it
 * doesn't try to reconstruct the full cross-network path (that would require a protocol
 * change to append hop lists to the wire).
