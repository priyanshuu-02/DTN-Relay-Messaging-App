# DTN Mesh Relay — Target Architecture (LoRa WiFi-AP Hubs)

**Status:** Design proposal · **Date:** 2026-07-02 · **Scope:** architecture only, no code changed yet
**Decision inputs:** Hub hardware = Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 · Phone-to-phone P2P = BLE primary, WiFi Direct fallback

---

## 1. Why this document exists

The app was originally built around the idea that **each phone owns one LoRa radio**, driven through the
unmodified Meshtastic app over AIDL. That is *not* the target. The target is:

> A **LoRa device is a WiFi Access Point (hub)** that several phones connect to over WiFi at once.
> Hubs talk to each other over long-range LoRa RF. Phones also talk directly to each other over BLE /
> WiFi Direct. Messages survive lack of end-to-end connectivity via **store-carry-forward** and
> **data-mule** phones. The system is **independent of Meshtastic**, running custom firmware on the LoRa modules.

This document specifies that target architecture, the required changes, and the hub firmware.

---

## 2. Current vs. target

| Aspect | Current (Meshtastic-based) | Target (independent hubs) |
|---|---|---|
| LoRa access | 1 phone ⇄ 1 radio over BLE/serial, via Meshtastic app AIDL | Many phones ⇄ 1 hub over WiFi; hub ⇄ hub over LoRa |
| LoRa radio owner | Meshtastic app | Custom ESP32 firmware (this repo) |
| Phone↔LoRa link | `MeshtasticTransportAdapter` (AIDL + broadcasts) | `LoRaHubTransportAdapter` (WiFi STA → hub SoftAP, framed TCP) |
| Phone↔phone link | `WifiDirectTransportAdapter` | BLE primary + WiFi Direct fallback |
| Bundle envelope | src/dest carried by Meshtastic `DataPacket.from/to` | **Self-contained DTN header** (src/dest inside the bundle) |
| DTN intelligence | On the phone | On the phone (unchanged); LoRa backbone stays "dumb" |

**Key insight:** the DTN engine (`DtnOrchestrator`, PRoPHET/MaxProp, `DoubleQLearningEngine`,
`MessageQueueManager`, scheduler, DB, export, UI) only depends on the `MeshTransport` / `DtnTransport`
interfaces. It is fully transport-agnostic. **The pivot is localized to the transport layer.**

---

## 3. Roles

### 3.1 Phone (DTN node — the brain)
- Creates messages; runs the store-carry-forward buffer (`MessageQueueManager` + Room).
- Runs encounter-based routing: PRoPHET / MaxProp / Double Q-Learning.
- Connects opportunistically to:
  - a **LoRa hub** over WiFi (STA joins the hub's SoftAP) — new `LoRaHubTransportAdapter`;
  - **other phones** over BLE (primary) or WiFi Direct (fallback) — encounter-based P2P.
- Acts as a **data mule**: buffers others' messages and carries them between regions.

### 3.2 LoRa hub (ESP32 — the bridge + backbone)
- Runs a **WiFi SoftAP**; several phones join simultaneously.
- Runs a **framed TCP server** on port 9740 for phones to push/pull bundles.
- Keeps its **own bundle buffer** (LoRa is slow → must queue).
- Bridges WiFi ⇄ LoRa and forwards hub-to-hub using **controlled flooding**:
  message-ID **dedup**, **TTL**, and a **hop limit**. No Q-learning on the hub.

**Division of labor:** the phones are smart (adaptive routing on the volatile P2P/mule layer);
the LoRa backbone is simple and reliable (flood-with-dedup on the stable infrastructure layer).

## 4. Topology & message flows

```
   REGION A (Hub A = ESP32 SoftAP)              REGION B (Hub B = ESP32 SoftAP)
   SSID "DTN-HUB-A", 192.168.4.1                SSID "DTN-HUB-B", 192.168.4.1
        ^   ^   ^  (WiFi STA join,                     ^   ^   ^
        |   |   |   framed TCP :9740)                   |   |   |
      A1  A2  A3                                       B1  B2  B3
        \__ BLE / WiFi-Direct __/                        \__ BLE / WiFi-Direct __/
                     |                                          ^
                     \___ phone A2 physically carries __________/  (data mule)

        Hub A  <========== long-range LoRa RF (SX1262) ==========>  Hub B
                controlled flooding + msg-ID dedup + TTL + hop-limit
```

1. **Phone → Hub:** phone opens TCP to hub, sends `REGISTER` (announces its nodeId) then `BUNDLE` frames.
2. **Hub buffering + dedup:** hub records the message-ID; if the destination phone is connected locally,
   it delivers over WiFi immediately; otherwise it queues the bundle for LoRa.
3. **Hub ⇄ Hub (LoRa):** hub transmits queued bundles; receiving hubs dedup, deliver to any locally
   connected destination phone, and re-flood if hops/TTL remain.
4. **Hub → Phone:** when the destination phone is connected, the hub pushes buffered bundles to it.
5. **No hub present:** phones still exchange bundles directly over BLE / WiFi Direct (encounter-based),
   and mules carry them between regions. Long-haul is the LoRa backbone; local is BLE/WiFi Direct.

---

## 5. Self-contained bundle wire format (REQUIRED CHANGE)

Today `DtnWireCodec` uses a 24-byte header and relies on Meshtastic's `DataPacket.from/to` for addressing.
Independent hub-to-hub LoRa frames have **no outer envelope**, so origin and destination must move **into**
the header. Proposed 32-byte header (big-endian):

| Offset | Size | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0  | 16 | `messageId` | UUID; used for dedup on hubs |
| 16 | 4  | `originNodeId` | uint32 (was in `DataPacket.from`) |
| 20 | 4  | `destinationNodeId` | uint32 (was in `DataPacket.to`) |
| 24 | 2  | `ttlMinutes` | uint16, counts down |
| 26 | 1  | `hopCount` | incremented per LoRa re-flood |
| 27 | 1  | `messageType` | `DtnMessageType.wireValue` |
| 28 | 1  | `channel` | 0 = primary |
| 29 | 1  | `fragmentIndex` | 0 = single frame |
| 30 | 1  | `fragmentTotal` | 1 = no fragmentation |
| 31 | 1  | `reserved` | 0x00 |

**Payload budget:** SX126x max single LoRa frame = 255 bytes → usable payload = 255 − 32 = **223 bytes**.
Keep bundles ≲ 200 bytes to limit airtime; fragment above that. Node IDs are now **app-generated 32-bit**
values (no longer Meshtastic `!hex`), but `NodeId` can keep its string form and map to/from uint32.

Impacted files: `model/DtnMessage.kt`, `receiver/DtnWireCodec.kt`, `test/.../DtnWireCodecTest.kt`.

---

## 6. Independence from Meshtastic — exact scope

**Remove / retire:** `MeshtasticTransportAdapter`, `app/src/main/aidl/org/meshtastic/**`,
`org.meshtastic.core.model.*` Parcelables, Meshtastic broadcast wiring. Keep `docs/meshtastic-ref/` only as
historical reference.

**Add:** `LoRaHubTransportAdapter : DtnTransport` — connects phone (WiFi STA) to hub SoftAP, speaks the
framed TCP protocol below. Structurally mirrors the existing `WifiDirectTransportAdapter` (length-prefixed
TCP framing over sockets). Also a `BleTransportAdapter : DtnTransport` for P2P (see §8).

**Unchanged (transport-agnostic):** `service/DtnOrchestrator`, `queue/`, `routing/` (PRoPHET, MaxProp,
StrategySelector), `learning/` (Double Q-Learning), `scheduler/`, `database/`, `export/`, UI.
`MultiTransportManager` already merges multiple transports — just register the new adapters.

---

## 7. Phone ⇄ Hub protocol (framed TCP, port 9740)

> **Authoritative implementation:** this section (and the firmware snippet in §9) is the original proposal.
> The shipped protocol/firmware live in **`firmware/src/main.cpp`** + **`firmware/README.md`** and the
> Android **`LoRaHubTransportAdapter.kt`** — refer to those if anything below drifts. The one addition since
> this proposal is the `HELLO` frame, included in the table below.

Frame: `[1B type][2B length BE][payload...]`

| Type | Value | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HELLO` | 0x03 | 4B hubId | Hub → phone on connect, so the phone treats the hub as an encountered peer |
| `REGISTER` | 0x01 | 4B nodeId | Phone announces its id so the hub can map nodeId → socket for direct delivery |
| `BUNDLE` | 0x02 | DTN bundle (32B header + payload) | A DTN message in either direction |

- On connect the hub sends `HELLO` (its id); the phone sends `REGISTER` (its id), then `BUNDLE`s for
  anything it wants to inject.
- Hub sends `BUNDLE`s to a phone when a buffered bundle's destination matches that phone's registered id, and
  fans out broadcast bundles (dest `0xFFFFFFFF`) to every connected phone.
- Delivery over this reliable TCP link is a hop-level handoff, not end-to-end proof (the phone layer uses
  `ROUTING_ACK` receipts for true delivery confirmation).

---

## 8. Phone ⇄ Phone (BLE primary, WiFi Direct fallback)

**Why BLE primary:** while a phone is joined to a hub's SoftAP (WiFi STA), running WiFi Direct
concurrently is unreliable on many Android devices. BLE coexists cleanly with WiFi STA, so BLE is the
default P2P path when attached to a hub; WiFi Direct is used when no hub is present (higher throughput).

**Planned `BleTransportAdapter : DtnTransport`:**
- Each phone runs a **GATT server** advertising a DTN service UUID + a "bundle" characteristic, and also
  **scans** for that UUID to connect as a GATT client — symmetric, encounter-based.
- On connect: emit a `NodeEncounterEvent` (drives the orchestrator's forwarding evaluation, exactly like
  today). Exchange bundles by writing the DTN wire bytes to the characteristic (chunked to the MTU, ~185–244B).
- `MultiTransportManager.sendMessage` picks per-peer: BLE if the peer is a BLE neighbor, else WiFi Direct,
  else the LoRa hub. (The current WiFi-Direct-then-LoRa priority generalizes to BLE → WiFi Direct → LoRa.)

BLE's ~10 m range and small MTU suit short, opportunistic encounters; WiFi Direct's ~100 m / higher
throughput suits bulk sync when a phone is not tied to a hub.

### 9.3 Firmware caveats before relying on it
- **This snippet is out of date** — it predates the `HELLO` frame (§7) and the broadcast fan-out. Use
  `firmware/src/main.cpp` as the source of truth; the snippet is kept only to show the original shape.
- Set `LORA_FREQ` to your **legally allowed band** and respect regional **duty-cycle** limits. The current
  flooding has no duty-cycle pacer — fine for 2–4 hubs, add pacing before scaling.
- Header offsets **must** match the finalized `DtnWireCodec` (§5).
- ESP32 SoftAP reliably serves ~4 (up to ~8) concurrent clients — matches ~3 phones/region.
- No LoRa encryption here; add AES if confidentiality is required over the air.

---

## 10. Implementation plan (when approved — not started)

1. Extend wire header with origin + destination (`DtnMessage`, `DtnWireCodec`, update `DtnWireCodecTest`).
2. Add `LoRaHubTransportAdapter : DtnTransport` (WiFi STA → SoftAP, framed TCP :9740, REGISTER + BUNDLE).
3. Add `BleTransportAdapter : DtnTransport` (GATT server + scanner, encounter-based).
4. Update `TransportModule` / `MultiTransportManager`: register LoRa-hub + BLE + WiFi-Direct; retire Meshtastic AIDL path; set send priority BLE → WiFi Direct → LoRa hub.
5. Finalize + flash firmware (`platformio.ini` + `src/main.cpp`), one per hub with unique `HUB_ID`/`AP_SSID`.

Steps 1–4 reuse patterns already in `WifiDirectTransportAdapter`; the DTN engine is untouched.

---

## 11. Constraints & open risks

- **WiFi STA + WiFi Direct concurrency** is device-dependent → mitigated by BLE-primary P2P.
- **LoRa airtime / duty cycle** limits throughput; keep bundles small, add pacing.
- **SoftAP client cap** (~4–8) bounds phones-per-hub.
- **Flooding scalability**: dedup + hop-limit are enough for a few hubs; a smarter hub routing scheme
  would be needed for many hubs.
- **Security**: WiFi WPA2 on the SoftAP and BLE pairing cover the local links; add payload/LoRa encryption
  if end-to-end confidentiality is required.
```

## 12. Addendum — routing math & multi-phone concurrency (as shipped)

> Added after the original proposal. §1–§11 describe the *transport* pivot; this section records the
> **routing engine** and **concurrency** work that shipped on the phone side. The engine remains fully
> transport-agnostic (§6). Authoritative code: `routing/ProphetStrategy.kt`, `routing/MaxPropStrategy.kt`,
> `service/DtnOrchestrator.kt`. See `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` §B.9–B.12 for the change log.

### 12.1 PRoPHET (RFC 6693)

Delivery predictability `P(a, b) ∈ [0, 1]` per destination. Research basis: Lindgren, Doria, Davies,
Grasic, *Probabilistic Routing Protocol for Intermittently Connected Networks*, **RFC 6693** (2014).

- **Encounter (delta-capped):** `P = P_old + (1 − δ − P_old) · P_enc`. The cap `1 − δ` (`δ = 0.01`)
  keeps `P` below `1.0`, which removes the saturation bug where a close peer looked permanently optimal.
- **Adaptive `P_enc`:** full `P_init = 0.75` on a first contact / gap `≥ I_typ`; scaled by `interval / I_typ`
  for faster re-encounters (`I_typ = 30 s`) so a stationary in-range peer does not inflate `P`.
- **Aging:** `P = P · γ^k`, `γ = 0.98`, over `k` elapsed windows.
- **Transitivity:** `P(a,c) += (1 − P(a,c)) · P(a,b) · P(b,c) · β`, `β = 0.25`, from exchanged summaries.
- The earlier additive `ε^d` distance term was **removed** (it was the saturation cause); the distance-aware
  idea survives only as the opt-in **STABLE-PROPHET** link-quality variant.

### 12.2 MaxProp (cost-based, Dijkstra)

Research basis: Burgess, Gallagher, Jensen, Levine, *MaxProp: Routing for Vehicle-Based Disruption-Tolerant
Networks*, **IEEE INFOCOM 2006**.

- Each node's likelihood vector `f` (`Σf = 1`) gives per-edge cost `(1 − f)`; neighbours' vectors are cached
  from `ROUTING_SUMMARY` handshakes to build a small multi-hop graph.
- `findMinCostNextHop` runs **Dijkstra** from a synthetic source `ME` over `(1 − f)` costs; a bundle is
  forwarded to a peer only when that peer is the **min-cost next hop** toward the destination.
- New bundles (`hopCount ≤ 1`) get a `1.5×` **head-start** (Burgess §III-C); a hard `maxHops = 10` bounds
  runaway spread. Direct delivery and broadcast bypass the cost check.

### 12.3 Multi-phone concurrency (send path)

The orchestrator's single event loop no longer *awaits* blocking BLE sends. Instead:

- **Coalesced flush** — one flush at a time (`flushMutex.tryLock`), re-running once if more work arrived,
  so bursty triggers don't stack.
- **Parallel per-peer fan-out** bounded by a `Semaphore(4)`, with a **per-peer `Mutex`** so writes to one
  GATT link never interleave. A slow/unreachable phone can't stall the others.
- **Connect backoff (10 s)** skips a peer that just failed instead of re-paying the ~8 s connect timeout.
- **Receipt de-duplication** sends only new `ROUTING_ACK` UIDs per peer (Briar/Bramble-style "offer only
  what's missing"), short-circuiting on failure.
- **Broadcast** is cleared from the buffer only after a confirmed fan-out to every online peer.

These ideas are informed by Meshtastic's managed-flooding (listen-before-transmit / suppression) and
Briar/Bramble pairwise sync; only the concurrency + dedup lessons were adopted (the LoRa backbone keeps its
own simpler flood-with-dedup in firmware).

### 12.4 Background housekeeping worker & research export

- **Periodic worker.** `scheduler/ForwardingWorker` is a `@HiltWorker` run by WorkManager every 15 min
  (`DtnForegroundService` enqueues it). It does *housekeeping only* — TTL expiry, reverting timed-out
  forwards, purging terminal messages, routing aging, draining pending Q-updates to the orchestrator,
  buffer-pressure enforcement, and low-reachability (`P < pMinThreshold`) drops. Real-time forwarding stays
  on the orchestrator's encounter path; the worker never transmits directly.
- **DI wiring (required for the worker to run).** Because the worker uses `@AssistedInject`,
  `DtnMeshApplication` implements `Configuration.Provider` and supplies a `HiltWorkerFactory`, and the
  manifest removes WorkManager's default `WorkManagerInitializer`. Without this the default factory throws
  `NoSuchMethodException` on the assisted constructor when the cycle fires in the background.
- **Research export.** `export/ResearchExporter` + `export/FileExportHelper` write a benchmark archive
  (`encounters.csv`, `contacts.csv`, `decisions.csv`, `messages.csv`, `q_tables.json`, `metadata.json`),
  triggered from the app's **Log tab** ("Export telemetry"). Useful for offline analysis of the routing /
  RL behaviour described above.
